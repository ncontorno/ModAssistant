# ModAssistant

Mod Assistant by /u/ncontorno

ModAssistant is a bot I created for /r/every_one_is_mod. We get requests at random times to be added as a moderator and sometimes someone isn't always online. When we would get to it, the requester could be offline and wouldn't respond to the invite clogging up the invite list. This bot solved that problem.

I am not a coder at all. I pieced this bot together by scouring reddit and the internet for what I needed. It may be sloppy, but it gets the job done.

Current features:

    Automatic invitation to moderate
    Automatic accepting of moderator invitations to bot
    Handling for deleted users and non-username mentions
    Handling if bot is not a moderator of subreddit or has incorrect permissions
    Optional banlist of users to not invite
    Replies to tell user what action (if any) was taken and why

To use the bot:

    Send a moderator invitation to /u/ModAssistant
    Make sure the bot has full permissions to be able to invite
    If you want a banlist, create a wiki page called 'banlist' (see below for more info)
    Call the bot by username and the words 'mod me'
    Example: mod me /u/ModAssistant

How to use the banlist

Create a wiki page titled 'banlist'. Once that page is created, enter one user per line with two spaces at the end to make sure there is one user per line. Make sure the username is exactly as it is displayed (capitalization). You can also put reasons after the name using a dash.

Here is an example of a banlist wiki page

ncontorno - causing trouble  
ModAssistant - why not  
___someuser___ - there needs to be a space after the username
